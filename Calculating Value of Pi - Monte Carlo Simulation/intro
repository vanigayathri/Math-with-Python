Monte Carlo Simulations can be thought of as computational algorithms that enable us to model probabilities that are difficult to calculate. This is done by using repeated random sampling to our advantage. With random sampling, the data we are using has no bias so we can simulate situations where the probabilities we obtain are close to the actual value. The more random data we use, the closer we get to the true value. Monte Carlo Simulations find their use in various fields, like Finance, Telecommunications and much more, however, we will not get into that in this article. In this article, we will analyze the use of a simple Monte Carlo Simulation to calculate the value of Ï€ (pi).
